# deformation-resistance-defect-detection-algorithm
This is a simple implementation of a deformation-resistant defect detection algorithm.
## Background
Fabric deformation is easily caused by external forces. This is a real but little-studied problem. It often affects the accuracy of defect detection algorithms. Especially when facing pattern fabrics, the deformation may even lead to the failure of defect detection.
Therefore, a fabric defect detection algorithm based on fuzzy matching and mismatch point clustering is proposed to deal with the negative effects of deformation.
## Usage
Please modify the image path on lines 18~20 in the file main.cpp according to the actual storage location of the image. Path1 is the sample image, Path2 is the template and Path3 is the Ground Truth image.
